React + Typescript

1. Create the project using the next command:
```
$ npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

Note: when the comment finishes, you will be able to see that commands like:
npm start, npm run build, etc. are available now

2. To avoid confusions let's remove all the things in `src` folder.
