# Taller React Native

First of all considering the dev 
process is similar to react, but 
instead of using html components, 
we are using components for mobile
applications.


### Installation 

requirements:
- node
    if you need to update node:
    - sudo npm cache clean -f
    - sudo npm install -g n
    - sudo n stable
- npm
- git
- expo
    npm install --global expo-cli

### Create a new project

$ expo init <your_name_project>
$ expo init create-native-test
    --> select blank
    note: all the options are template that you
          can use.

### Start your app

$ npm start

### Run your app

$ npm run android

### How to see it 

You can read the QR in your android device, but
in iOS there is a caviat, we can not use the 
QR, but you can send an email and open the link.

Another thing is we are sharing this app like a
web server, so you will need to be connected in the same
LAN, so the easy way to share this is using the 
CONNECTION TUNNEL option.

#### Android Studio

Another option is using Android Studio, so once you have
installed android studio, you can go to Configure, and 
AVD manager, and execute the default virtual device.

Once you have this you can use the option Run on Android 
device/emulator.
